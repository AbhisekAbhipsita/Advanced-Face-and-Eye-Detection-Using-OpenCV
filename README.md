# Face and Eye Detection System

![Face and Eye Detection](face and eye detection.png)

## Project Description

This project is a face and eye detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers. The system detects faces and eyes in images and displays the results with bounding boxes.In my latest capstone project, I developed a robust face and eye detection system using OpenCV's Haar Cascade Classifiers. This project involved implementing image processing techniques to accurately detect and highlight facial features in real-time. By leveraging Python and libraries such as NumPy and OpenCV, I created a system capable of identifying faces and eyes within various images, ensuring high precision and performance.

### Features
- Real-time face detection
- Eye detection within detected faces
- High accuracy with Haar Cascade Classifiers

### Technologies Used

- OpenCV: Utilized for implementing Haar Cascade Classifiers for face and eye detection.
- Python: Employed for scripting and integrating various image processing functions.
- NumPy: Used for efficient numerical computations and array manipulations.
- Image Processing: Applied techniques such as color conversion and region of interest (ROI) extraction.
- Computer Vision: Developed an understanding of object detection and feature extraction methods.
- Debugging and Optimization: Enhanced performance and accuracy by fine-tuning parameters and implementing best practices.

This project not only strengthened my expertise in computer vision and image processing but also demonstrated my ability to apply advanced machine learning techniques to - solve real-world problems.
